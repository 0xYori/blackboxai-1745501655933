# Modern SMTP Test Tool

## Project Overview
The Modern SMTP Test Tool is a web-based application designed to help users easily test their connection to various SMTP servers. With a user-friendly interface, the tool allows users to input SMTP server details, configure email parameters, and check the connectivity and credentials against the specified SMTP server. This application is especially useful for developers and system administrators who need to ensure their email configurations are set up correctly.

## Installation
To run the SMTP Test Tool locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smtp-test-tool.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd smtp-test-tool
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser. There are no dependencies to install as this project relies on external libraries available via CDNs.

## Usage
Once the application is open in your browser:
1. Enter the SMTP host (or IP address) for the server you want to test.
2. Select the email port and the security option (SSL, TLS, etc.).
3. Fill in the required credentials (username, password, from email, to email, and subject).
4. Click on the "Test Connection" button to initiate the SMTP connection test.
5. The debug console will log the connection process and the results.

## Features
- Input fields for SMTP host, port, security type, and email details (from/to).
- Quick selection buttons for popular SMTP servers (SendGrid, Mailgun, Gmail, etc.).
- Debug console displaying the step-by-step process and result of the SMTP connection attempt.
- Visual feedback for successful or failed connection attempts.
- Responsive design with a modern user interface.
